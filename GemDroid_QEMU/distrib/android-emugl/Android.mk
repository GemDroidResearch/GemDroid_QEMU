# For the import/export feature to work properly, you must include

# module A, then it must be included after module A below.
#
# This ensures that anything exported by module A will be correctly
# be imported by module B when it is declared.
#
# Note that the build system will complain if you try to import a
# module that hasn't been declared yet anyway.
#

# Required by our units test.
